# Fruits Detection YOLOv8

This repo use the pretrained model YOLOv8s to training with the egg-data that provided by teacher. After that I download the mix data of apple, egg, orange and mango from roboflow universe to train agian and get the best model. Then use the best model to predict and show the result in matrix.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Build and train deep learning models to detect mix fruits images.
- **Models**: YOLOv8
- **Environment**: Google Colab (with GPU support)
- **Data**: [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/)
- **Notebooks**: [Fruits Detection](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mloiEb-3UzHlY1KrYO9JbJMpOuJdkcZT/view?usp=sharing)
